Java == Stream<T>

Spring = dependency, Injection, Framework

Dependency? Dependency Relationship
client -> supplier
When the change in the supplier affects the client (field, method parameter, local variable)
Object dependencies that are determined at runtime, not at compile time

OOP ? reusable

Inversion of Control

Framework

Method Signature (method name, parameter types) : overriding
Method Type (return type, method type parameter, method argument types, exception) : Method Reference
